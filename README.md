# Internship

I separated all the tasks for better structure.

The task_1 and task_3 files contain Java code for exercises 1 and 3, respectively. The second part of exercise 3, which includes the key questions, is answered in comments below the code.

The answers to the theoretical questions for exercises 2 and 4 are provided in the two PDF files named Exercise 2.pdf and Exercise 4.pdf, respectively.
